# Trustee GPU appraisal policy.
#
# Written for the REMOTE verifier (NRAS).
#
# The local verifier emits a much thinner claim set (arch, uuid,
# measurements, config) and compares nothing against NVIDIA's reference
# integrity manifests, which would leave the RIM values to be transcribed
# into Rego/RVPS and re-transcribed on every driver and VBIOS update. NRAS
# does that comparison against NVIDIA's signed RIMs and reports the verdict, 
# so the claims below are appraisals rather than raw measurements.
#
# Claims are NVIDIA's EAT payload passed through verbatim (nras_response.rs),
# one device per appraisal, plus x-nvidia-overall-att-result lifted from the
# JWT. The same claims (claims 3.0 on /v4) are featured in ITA policy but in
# a different envelope: flat under input.nvidia rather than nested per
# device under input.nvgpu.claim_details.
#
# Flat because Trustee sends one device per NRAS request and rejects a
# response carrying more than one detached EAT. A multi-GPU node is handled
# a layer up instead, where the broker raises one appraisal per device and
# runs this same file against each, so nothing here needs to iterate.
